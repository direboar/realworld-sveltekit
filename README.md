> ### [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)+[Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)+[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://realworld-sveltekit-q5tn.vercel.app/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Svelte + Sveltekit + Typescript** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Svelte + Sveltekit + Typescript** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
